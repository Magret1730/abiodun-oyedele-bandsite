                The Bees Knees is a pop rock band originating from San Francisco,
                California. The band consists a dynamic lineup featuring two lead
                vocalists, two guitarists, a bassist, a keyboardist and a drummer.
                The band achieved its first commercial success as an unsigned act,
                drawing attention from their future manager. Having extensive
                experience working with both new and seasoned acts, the manager
                was confident the band could succeed even further with more
                support, pushing The Bees Knees to sign with a well known record
                label.

                From there, the band has soared, gaining international recognition
                and ranking in the top 10 on the Poster Charts. New fans
                immediately fell in love with the band’s original and organic
                attitude, solidifying their place as one of the hottest and
                fastest up and coming acts of this century. Fans affectionately
                refer to themselves as “The Hive” and are drawn to their candid
                and authentic performances on stage. The Bees Knees are currently
                recording their second studio album, looking to be released in
                early 2024.
