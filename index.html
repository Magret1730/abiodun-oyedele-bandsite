                        The Bees Knees is a pop rock band
                        originating from San Francisco, California. The band consists a dynamic
                        lineup featuring two lead vocalists, two guitarists, a bassist, a
                        keyboardist and a drummer. The band achieved its first commercial success as
                        an unsigned act, drawing attention from their future manager. Having
                        extensive experience working with both new and seasoned acts, the manager
                        was confident the band could succeed even further with more support, pushing
                        The Bees Knees to sign with a well known record label.

                    <section class="about__text">
                        From there, the band has soared, gaining international recognition and ranking
                        in the top 10 on
                        the Poster Charts. New fans immediately fell in love with the band’s
                        original and organic attitude, solidifying their place as one of the hottest
                        and fastest up and coming acts of this century. Fans affectionately refer to
                        themselves as “The Hive” and are drawn to their candid and authentic
                        performances on stage. The Bees Knees are currently recording their second
                        studio album, looking to be released in early 2024.
